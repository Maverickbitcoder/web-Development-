# 🎮 Mini Web Games Collection

Welcome to the **Mini Web Games Collection**, a curated set of interactive browser-based games developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These projects were created to enhance my front-end development skills and to demonstrate how core web technologies can be used to build fun, responsive, and interactive user experiences.

Each game is self-contained and designed with simplicity, usability, and functionality in mind—no frameworks, no dependencies—just pure web development!
